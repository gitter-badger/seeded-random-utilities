# seeded-random-utilities
Common random functions that are seedable with TypeScript support 



## Motivations

In a recent project I was working on I needed the use of a seeded random number generator, preferably written in TypeScript.
## Links
* "[rand-seed - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rand-seed)" - Provides the seeded random implementation powering the utilities.  Also directly used a lot of the TypeScript setup and project design from here, blending it partly with the following tutorial link and other random utilities.
* "[How to Create and Publish an NPM module in TypeScript](https://codeburst.io/https-chidume-nnamdi-com-npm-module-in-typescript-12b3b22f0724)" - One of the best tutorials on how to publish a TypeScript package that is usefulable in both JavaScript and TypeScript.
* "[Math.random() - JavaScript | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random)" - This MDN web doc provided the inspriation and logic behind many of the utilties.  They were adpated to both seeding and into TypeScript.
* "[random-utility - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-utility)" - I created seeded versions of a few of these utitlities.  It wasn't a straight rip, more just inspiration.
